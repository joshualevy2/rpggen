# Notes for Rpggen Developers

This page contains information for people who want to help out the Rpggen project by adding to the code base.

## Basic Rules

* Please continue with the existing coding conventions, especially:
** 3 character indentation, and all indentation based on spaces (not tabs)
** Put functions in alphabetical order within classes and classes in alphabetical order within files.

* If you add code, then you must write tests!  Look in the tests directory, and use unittest if at all possible.
