<tr><td align='right'>1</td><td>Weapons or Armor: Can not turn on one weapons system.  Easy (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure injures the person doing the repair. </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>2</td><td>Weapons or Armor: One weapons system is locking or tracking things it should not.  Average (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure injures the person doing the repair. </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>3</td><td>Engineering problem: Environmental problems.  Hopeless (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure causes injury to someone not working on the repair! </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>4</td><td>Problem on the bridge: Screen fails or looks bad.  Easy (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>5</td><td>Engineering problem: No gravity.  Easy (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>6</td><td>Comm gear: All voices sound strange (high, low, etc.)  Staggering (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure makes it twice as bad. </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>7</td><td>Interior fixtures: Bed or chair collapses or can not be adjusted properly.  Difficult (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>

<tr><td align='right'>9</td><td>Interior fixtures: Interior lights don&amp;#039;t work (GM decides where).  Formidable (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>10</td><td>Problem on the bridge: Leak (oil, water, A/C, etc.)  Difficult (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure injures the person doing the repair. </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>11</td><td>Weapons or Armor: Can not turn on one weapons system. Ignore it and it will slowly get worse. Easy (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>12</td><td>Comm gear: Comm system makes a very loud noise, but only occationally  Difficult (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure causes injury to someone not working on the repair! </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>13</td><td>Weapons or Armor: One weapons system is giving false warnings or errors. Ignore it and it will slowly get worse. Average (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure means you can not fix it later. After the repair, roll d6.  On a 6 the failure reoccures a few minutes (or hours) later.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>14</td><td>Comm gear: Tagging data is all wrong; looks like your ship is faking its communications.  Difficult (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure makes it twice as bad. </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>15</td><td>Engineering problem: Can not jump. Ignore it and it will slowly get worse. Difficult (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>16</td><td>Interior fixtures: Bad smell somewhere on board.  Easy (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>17</td><td>Interior fixtures: Door or bulkhead is stuck  Difficult (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>18</td><td>Comm gear: Tagging data is all wrong; looks like your ship is faking its communications. If not fixed, it will quickly deteriorate. Formidable (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure causes injury to someone not working on the repair! </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>19</td><td>Fuel system: Fuel leak goes to the outside. Ignore it and it will slowly get worse. Difficult (BITS Task) to fix.  </td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>20</td><td>Comm gear: Comm system fails enirely sometimes, but only for 6 minutes. Ignore it and it will slowly get worse. Easy (BITS Task) to fix. A critical failure makes it twice as bad. </td></tr>
